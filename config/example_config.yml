# Highly Recommend To set up Twilio Account to receive text messages. So if bot doesn't work you'll at least get a phone
# text message with the url link. You can click the link and try manually purchasing on your phone.

# -----------------------------------------------Steps To Complete------------------------------------------------------

# Test Link 1 - Ryzen 5800x seems to be available quite often. It is the best URL to try out preorder script.
# To actually avoid buying CPU, you can comment out Line 220. Uncomment the line when you are done testing.

# Test Link 2 (cheap HDMI cable) - https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dynex-6-hdmi-cable-black/6405508.p?skuId=6405508
# *Warning* - Script will try to checkout the HDMI cable twice since this is how the Bestbuy preorder script works
# Best buy makes us click the add to cart button twice to enter Queue System.
# Don't worry about script buying two graphics cards though. The script will only buy one.
# As well, Best buy won't let you check out more than 1 item.
# To actually avoid buying HDMI cable, set test_mode to 'True'. Set to 'False' when you are done testing.

# 1. General Settings
test_mode: True  # Set test_mode to True when testing bot checkout process, and set it to False when your done testing.
headless_mode: False  # Set False for testing. If True, it will hide Firefox in background for faster checkout speed.
docker_mode: False # Set False to run in Pycharm. If True, will only run in Docker.
webpage_refresh_timer: 3  # Default 3 seconds. If slow internet and the page isn't fully loading, increase this.
# The number of workers can be increased. Note this will throttle how many products can be watched. Having 10 items in the product list
# but workerCount to 5 will mean only the first 5 products will be watched.
# ***Warning*** setting this value too high and/or having too many items in your product list could result in very poor system performance, and your internet may not support that load.
# If increasing workerCount, then it's also recommended to set 'options.headless' in the driver configuration to 'true'
# All will run at the same time. You could end up purchasing all of the products you have specified in the list.
workerCount: 5

# 2. Product URLS: Add each product 'short hand product name' : 'product url' Repeat for as many products as desired. '#' comments out the product and the script will not attempt to purchase those commented products.
